# Panic-Disorder-Detection

The aim of this project is to create and provide an easier way of self-diagnosing Panic Disorders using Machine Learning. The application is deployed in Flask and interaction with the project is made easy through web pages.

## Sci-kit Version 
We have used Sci-Kit version 1.2.2 for both training the data and deploying the websites. This was done because varying versions in the training phase and the deploying environment might cause errors during the latter

```bash
pip install sci-kit==1.2.2
```
