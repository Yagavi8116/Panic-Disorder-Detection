#The Panic Disorder Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model that can be accessed through a website, enabling individuals to diagnose themselves with panic disorder using multimodal physiological and spatiotemporal data. By analyzing various signals such as heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, and respiratory patterns, the model will provide accurate, real-time detection of panic disorder symptoms. The system will be user-friendly, integrating seamlessly with existing healthcare workflows and electronic health records (EHRs) to offer personalized treatment recommendations and alerts. This innovative solution seeks to improve early detection and management of panic disorder, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and accessibility to mental health care.
